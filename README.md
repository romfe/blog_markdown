## A repository for a simple blog that uses markdown

The code was written using Next.js with TypeScript and styling with Tailwind

This project was based upon this course, which teaches this exact same project (in addition to another, more complex one) but using JavaScript ~~which, in hindsight, would have been a much better idea~~

The project is currently in development and in the future the styling will probably get redone with SASS.

Thank you for your attention
